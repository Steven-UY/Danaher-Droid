# Danaher-Droid
---
#### Overview

I **suck** at Jiu-Jitsu and hate having to sift through all the instructionals online my attention span is too bad. Hence, I wanted to design a tool that could help me
not be so bad. With Danaher-Droid I hope that I can effectively perform retrieval augmented generation on transcripts contained within the BJJ Fanatics youtube channel.
So it's not really Danaher-Droid more like BJJ Fanatics droid but whatever Danaher sounds better.

With the Danaher-Droid I hope to:

 - Have the LLM respond with the right answers when asked about any BJJ position
 - To talk in John Danaher's voice
 - Look somewhat presentable
